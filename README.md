# CS241-lab6-Hunt-the-Wumpus
Project Overview

Hunt the Wumpus is an old text adventure game. In this game you, the adventurer-
researcher, explore a labyrinth room by room to search for and tag the legendary hunted
wumpus with research-grade gps-tagging arrows. Do this while avoiding hazards such as pits
of death and bats of incredible lifting strength. Oh, and donâ€™t get in the same room as the
wumpus because it will eat you.

In this assignment, I am providing you with the game logic in playwumpus.c and am
depending on you to manage the map information.

I am giving you a header file wumpus.h which defines the map structure and some func-
tions to manipulate and query it. You must implement these functions in wumpus.c.
